TETRONIMOS!
===========

Is what a maths geek screams when he's jumping out of an aeroplane.

This is a tetris-like "game" based on Question 6 of the Standard Bank IT Challenge finals.

The aim is to write a tetronimos playing program to compete with, um, your competitors.

Your tetris program is then put head-to-head with a competitors and compete for number of lines or highest score. Additionally, each program decides on the next piece to drop in their opponent's board, allowing your program to potentially screw up its opponents game.
